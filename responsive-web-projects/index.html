      <p>His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world. Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation". He currently has a bounty of Beli320,000,000, which is the 4th highest in the crew, after Luffy, Jinbe, and Sanji.</p>

      <p>His fame as a master swordsman and his great strength, along with the actions of his captain, sometimes led others to believe he was the true captain of the crew before he obtained his first bounty.</p>
